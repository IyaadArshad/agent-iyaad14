Table accounts, accounts have a few properties:
- Conversations
- Recently opened documents list (All documents are publicly accessible, there are no private documents or access levels, this is just storing the last 3 documents opened)
- Settings (Save user's settings)

When creating a new account, the defaults for the properties are:
- Conversations: None
- Recently opened documents list: None (To be populated up to 3 and then only the most recent three will be stored, removing older ones as the new ones come in.)
- Settings:
    - Use lite mode on first message: ENABLED (true)
